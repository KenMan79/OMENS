<h2>OMENSApp HoneyApp 0.45</h2>


<p>
  Do you see a lot of probes in your logs for Web applications or CMS systems written in 
  scripting languages that are not even installed on your server?  Things like 
  <b>WP-ADMIN.PHP or LOGIN.JSP</b>.
</p>


<p>
 It happens to me all the time.  I get hundreds. Nay, THOUSANDS of probes for WordPress, PHP, 
 and other known vulnerable scripts that aren't even on my server.  I could just ignore them.  
 After-all they just issue a 404 error. But I got to thinking...
</p>


<p>
 Why not intercept those probes, log them, and then block the IP address if there are more than
 a couple attempts?  After-all, there might be some good intel in those probes.  
</p>


<p>
 That's why I created OMENSApp.  It's just a fake scripting language that you can assign to any
 filetype in your web server.  Want to intercept PHP requests because you don't even have PHP
 on your server?  Just configure your web server to use OMENSApp for .PHP files.  It works just
 as well for .CFM, .JSP, .PL, or anthing else. And since OMENSApp uses the OMENS database to 
 log the IP address information, you can use OMENScan to not only generate a block file for 
 your web server, but to share those IP addresses with your other OMENS servers using OMENShare!
</p>


<p>
 Now you can go beyond just the 404 messages in your log.  OMENSApp will log Cookies, GET, and POST 
 data. To give you more information than you usually find in just looking at the web server logs.  If
 a 404 message is OK with you, OMENSApp probably isn't your cup of tea.  But if you ever wondered
 what else might be in those requests, OMENSApp can tell you. And can block those hostile IP addresses
 if they make more than a few (5) requests.
</p>


<h2>Setting up OMENSApp on IIS 7</h2>


<p>
 To use OMENSApp you must configure your web server to use OMENSAPP as the scripting language 
 for the URL requests you want to intercept.  For Instance: If you don't have PHP on your IIS 7 
 web server but you want to intercept any PHP requests - do the following

 <ol>
  <li>Ensure CGI is enabled:
  <li> 1. Control Panel > Programs and Features
  <li> 2. Turn Windows features on or off
  <li> 3. World Wide Web Service
  <li> 4. Application Development Features
  <li> 5. CGI
 </ol>


Then add OMENSApp to the Handle Mapping for PHP
 <ol>
  <li> Internet Information Services (IIS) Manager
  <li> 1. Handler Mappings
  <li> 2. Add Script Map
  <li> 3. *.PHP
  <li> 4. CgiModule
 </ol>
 
</p>


<h2>OMENSApp Database</h2>

<p>
 OMENSApp will use <b>C:\OMENS\DB\OMENScan.db</b> to store the hostile IP addresses.  When you 
 run your typical OMENScan (if configured for blocking), OMENScan will then write out those 
 IP Addresses into an IP block file.  This will usually require 4 or more attempts by a bad actor.
 This is done to make sure a single accidental typo doesn't cause someone to be blocked.  I admit
 that is unlikely, but if a bad guy tries once to probe for a vulnerable script, they are likely 
 to try several more times.  And 4 attempts seems like a low enough threshold.
</p>


<h2>OMENSApp Logfile</h2>

<p>
 OMENSApp will write a logfile to <b>C:\OMENS\DB\OMENSApp-&lt;yyyymmdd&gt;.log</b> where it will
 store the hostile data from the request.  This includes all kinds of information like IP Address, 
 Script they attempted to run, Cookies, URL and POST data.
</p>


<p>
 Keep in mind, the script files don't have to exist.  OMENSApp will pretend like every script 
 requested is there.
</p>


<h2>OMENSApp HTML Output</h2>

<p>
 Since OMENSApp is emulating an actual script running, it will send a web page to the requestor,
 That web page can be written by you.  The HTML output can be created in 
 <b>C:\OMENS\DB\OMENSApp.html</b>
</p>


<p>
 If you would like to to be more creative. Like write an entire Honey Pot application using 
 OMENSApp - Or if you simply want to write individual and unique web pages for certain OMENSApp 
 requests, you can add these web pages into to the <b>C:\OMENS\App\</b> directory.  The web  
 pages you want to mimic will have the same file name as the URL request.  So for instance: 
 If you want to code a special OMENSApp reply page for <b>Admin.PHP</b> simply create a web 
 page in <b>C:\OMENS\App\Admin.PHP</b>. This web page will then be returned by any URL 
 request for <b>Admin.PHP</b>. 
</p>



<h2>Persistence Cookie</h2>


<p>
  OMENSApp will add a Tracking Cookie called <b>passw</b>.  This helps track requests from
  the attacking browser, even if they change their IP Address.  This is not meant to be 
  perfect, but if an attacker makes several requests and does not clear their Cookies, 
  this can help tie the requests together.
</p>




<h2>Blocking Hostile IP Addresses</h2>


<p>
 To do the actual blocking you will need to configure and run OMENScan. You can check the
 OMENS Blocking help file for instructions on how to setup blocking.
