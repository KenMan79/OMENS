This text file lists licenses and attributions to code that OMENS has used from public 
sources:


1.OMENS MD5 implementation
The OMENS MD5 code was taken from - L. Peter Deutsch's (ghost@aladdin.com) implementation 
of RFC 1321 (MD5).

Heavy modifications were made to harden and to integrate the code with this OMENS.  But 
credit for the original code belongs to Mr Deutsch.  My thanks for a wonderful piece of
code!

2. OMENS RC4 (ARC4) implementation:
The OMENS RC4 encryption/decryption routine is covered by the Open Works License.  This is 
the ONLY portion of OMENS covered by this license - The remainder of OMENS code is NOT 
covered by the Open Works License.

My thanks to Sterling Camden for this great piece of code. which can be found here:

3. LibCurl
OMENS uses the LibCurl library for it's HTTP functions.  LibCurl is one of the most amazing
pieces of software I have ever used.  Simple, effective, and stable.  The LibCurl license is

dedicating their contributions to the public domain and originals of those signed affidavits 
are stored in a firesafe at the main offices of Hwaci. Anyone is free to copy, modify, 
publish, use, compile, sell, or distribute the original SQLite code, either in source code 
form or as a compiled binary, for any purpose, commercial or non-commercial, and by any means.

5. Various and Sundry:
As I developed OMENS I searched for all types of examples of source code.  Many of them I 
simply used to learn the concepts and coded the routines from that.  I have tried very hard to 
attribute any code I used.  If I have missed anybody it was not intentional, and I would 
be more than happy to add any attribution to this file.

6. My License:
The COMPILED version of OMENS is available to anybody and everybody provided that this 
copyright notice and this permission notice appear in all copies and distributions.

The OMENS software and configuration options are for use ONLY in protecting systems.  
OMENS may not be reverse engineered, or otherwise modified or used in a manner to perform 
any hostile action(s) against any computer systems.  OMENS is a defensive security tool, 
and may only be used as such.  

The OMENS source code may be made available to properly vetted organizations only.  This 
is an unfortunate hazard of computer security software: That inadvertent sharing of the 
source code with hostile entities may cause the software to be less effective. For this 
reason, OMENS source code may not be share or copied, and may only made available by 
the authorized maintainer(s) of the OMENS source code - Who are required to reasonably 
vet any recipient of the OMENS source code, who in turn must sign a Non-Disclosure 
agreement.

This software is furnished "as-is". We provide no warranty whatsoever, whether express, 
implied, or statutory, including, but not limited to, any warranty of merchantability or 
fitness for a particular reason or purpose, or any warranty that the software will be 
error-free.

In no respect shall the author or distributors of OMENS incur any liability for any damages, 
including, but not limited to, direct, indirect, special, or consequential damages arising 
out of, resulting from, or any way connected to the use of this software, whether or not 
based upon warranty, contract, tort, or otherwise; whether or not injury was sustained by 
persons or property or otherwise; and whether or not loss was sustained from, or arose out 
of, the results of, the software, or any services that may be provided by the software.

You agree to install and use this software solely at your own risk.
