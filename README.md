# OMENS
Object Monitor for Enhanced Network Security

Or simply, OMENS

OMENS was born out of the intrusion (and intrusion attempts) analysis that I have been doing over many years. I consistently run into intrusion attempts that existing IDS systems have difficulty detecting. OMENS is my attempt to better detect (and understand) these blind spots in existing systems.

OMENS is free,but not Open Source.  This is a concious decision made by me.  I have discussed this issue wih others that have created tools similar to OMENS.  Their story is consistent: Hostile actors use their source code to bypass the detections of their monitoring tool, and it becomes an un-winnable arms race.  I believe this is an inevitability and it is why I have not Open Sourced OMENS.

In order to prevent the time it would take me to play this game, I have decided to share the source code with only vetted researchers who want to help me advance OMENS capabilities.
